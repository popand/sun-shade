   - Ensure the capability is added in Xcode
   - Verify it's enabled in Apple Developer Portal
   - Clean build folder and rebuild

2. **Authentication fails**
   - Check that you're signed in to iCloud (device) or Apple ID (simulator)
   - Verify bundle identifier matches in Developer Portal
   - Ensure capability is properly configured

3. **User data not persisting**
   - Check UserDefaults access permissions
   - Verify data is being encoded/decoded properly
   - Clear app data and test fresh installation

4. **"This app cannot use Sign In with Apple"**
